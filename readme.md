# SEO Image Delete EXIF Data

This is a really simple app. It quickly just deletes the EXIF data found in your images. Fortunately, it is recursive so you can use your entire image folder to clean up the EXIF data before you use it online.

## Where to put images?

Put all of the images in the `/src/img/` folder.

## How to run the app?

```
npm run start:dev
```

### Bug Found

We didn't spend much time on this, so there is not anything that will tell you when it's done. There is an image counter built into it so you can match up the numbers. The images are only counted and not the folders.
